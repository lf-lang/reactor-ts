A Reactor-Oriented Programming Framework in TypeScript
---

The prime use of this runtime implementation is to support the [TypeScript target of Lingua Franca (LF)](https://www.lf-lang.org/docs/handbook/a-first-reactor?target=ts). LF is a coordination language that endows mainstream programming languages with an intuitive concurrency model and abstractions for specifying timed behaviors.

This runtime implementation can also be used standalone. Documentation and examples of such usage will be included in future releases of this module. Automatically generated [API docs](https://lf-lang.github.io/reactor-ts) are already available.
